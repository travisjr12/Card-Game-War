players get 16 cards, they then turn over the card, and the higher card wins if they are equal
then the next higer card drawn collects all cards, the player with the most cards wins! 
URL: file:///C:/Users/Travis/Desktop/WarGame6/index.html
i created class Deck to track cards, buildDeck() this._populate(); this._shuffle(); to bring out and shuffle cards and the suit, ranks, and value classes

my favorite features gives these meaning to the cards, the top down method was challenging to how cards were populated and brought back to the functions
solving solutions were helpful with chat gpt and instructor prerecordings
another challenge was the factoring of 0 vs 1 when 0 is really 1 for the total amount of cards and correcting the right numbers to slice the cards between players

this would bring out the randomizing factor of spade of 6 out of 26 cards
  constructor(rank, suit, value) {

    this.rank = rank;
    this.suit = suit;
    this.value = value;
  }

this shows what appeared inside the console randomly when shuffled 
  _populate() {
    const suits = ['♠', '♣', '♥', '♦'];
    const ranks = ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K'];
    const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13];
json files are needed to install and mocha and chai here in html file
